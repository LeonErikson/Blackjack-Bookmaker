Readme file for Leon's Blackjack Bookmaker

This program uses Python (at least version 3.6) and Tkinter to create a GUI that displays the correct blackjack plays for a given deck composition. 

To get started, run the program and then select your desired game rules from the rules menu item. The deck type can be set as infinite, finite number of full decks, or a custom deck composition. Other common blackjack rules can be toggled under this menu heading.

After the desired rules are selected, select build under the book menu item. This will populate the main display with the correct plays of H for hit, D for double, S for stand, and P for split for the selected deck and rules.

The correct plays for the hard and soft hands are determined deterministically, while the correct plays for the pair hands are determined by simulation.
